# Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal and major infectious pathogen of humans and animals. In humans, 25% of the population are persistent asymptomatic carriers in the anterior nares of the nose, and a further 50% are transient carriers (von Eiff et al., 2001, Safdar and Bradley, 2008). S. aureus can cause a diverse range of infections from minor skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) to more severe, and often fatal, systemic infections. Invasive infections are often caused by a patients’ own colonising strain (McCarthy et al., 2012a) indicating that the same previously harmless bacteria have the potential to cause a wide range of opportunistic infections. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is concerning as these reservoirs are resistant to β-lactamase resistant β-lactam antibiotics, the preferred treatment for staphylococcal infections, and/or other commonly prescribed antibiotics (Gould, 2005, Knight et al., 2012).
